"""
Pythonâ€™s zip function allows us to loop over multiple lists at the same time.

The zip function takes multiple lists and returns an iterable that provides a tuple of the
corresponding elements of each list as we loop over it.
Note that zip with different size lists will stop after the shortest list runs out of items.

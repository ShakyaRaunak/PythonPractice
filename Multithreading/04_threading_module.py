# Creating Thread Using Threading Module

"""
To implement a new thread using the threading module, you have to do the following âˆ’
- Define a new subclass of the Thread class.
- Override the __init__(self [,args]) method to add additional arguments.
- Then, override the run(self [,args]) method to implement what the thread should do when started.
Once you have created the new Thread subclass, you can create an instance of it and then start a new thread by invoking
the start(), which in turn calls run() method.
